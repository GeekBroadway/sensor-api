# Sensor API
---
## What is it?
**Sensor API is a service to connects single or multiple server devices (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Others) to multiple clients or users through either:**
* An API (Making API Calls)
* An iOS or Android App
* A web interface

## Function
* Servers make POSTs periodically to the API Server using an API Key
* Each client application makes requests to the server to get the latest data and displays it nicely
* Each client can access this data either by login or by a QA Key (Quick Authentication Key), Example:
   * #452-ASK
   * #324-SDF
* This QA Key makes it easy to quickly access the data per user, it is individual to the user, but shorter than a API Key.

## Features
* Used by those with an abundance of sensors throughout a location
* More effective than lots of wires, could be used with Arduino Mini's
* Easy interface and centralisation
* Could charge for premium access or some other addition to function
